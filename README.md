# WalletIQ: Intelligent wallet analytics and on-chain user behaviour profiling Implementation
> Advanced javascript solution leveraging modern architecture patterns and cutting-edge AI technology.

WalletIQ builds rich behavioural profiles from wallet histories, classifying users into DeFi power-user segments using unsupervised clustering and surfacing churn-risk signals for protocol growth teams.

WalletIQ's key benefits include:

* **High-performance architecture**: Leveraging optimised algorithms and efficient data structures for maximum throughput.
* **Modern development patterns**: Implementing contemporary software engineering practices and AI-driven design patterns.
* **Comprehensive testing**: Extensive test coverage ensuring reliability and production-grade maintainability.

## Key Features

* **AI-powered core**: Machine learning inference integrated directly into the hot path for real-time decision making.
* **Multi-chain compatibility**: Supports Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Arbitrum, and Polygon out of the box.
* **Configurable thresholds**: Environment-variable-driven configuration allows fine-tuning without code changes.
* **Observable by default**: Structured logging and Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoints included.
* **Extensive test suite**: Unit, integration, and simulation tests provide high confidence before deployment.

## Technology Stack

* **JavaScript**: Primary development language providing performance, reliability, and extensive ecosystem support.
* **Modern AI/ML tooling**: Leveraging state-of-the-art models for intelligent decision making.
* **Comprehensive testing infrastructure**: Ensuring code quality and production-grade reliability.
